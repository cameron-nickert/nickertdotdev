# Internal Notes


## 2026-02-13 16:26:22 -0500 — ats-recruiter
- Focused on ATS keyword coverage for payments/platform reliability roles.
- Primary source reviewed: fullscreen resume content in app/resume/fullscreen/page.tsx plus supporting context in context.md and content/project-history.ts.
- Noted gaps in compliance/operations keywords (PCI, disputes/chargebacks, reconciliation, settlement, SLAs/SLOs, incident response, on-call), and some generic phrasing in experience bullets.
- Prepared minimal, factual copy edits that add payments/platform specificity without adding new claims.
