ATS Risks
- Generic phrasing in experience bullets hides payments-platform scope and reduces keyword hits (e.g., “platform services,” “operational improvements”).
- Missing common payments/platform reliability keywords (disputes/chargebacks, reconciliation, settlement, authorization/capture, ledgering, PCI/compliance, on-call/incident response, SLAs/SLOs).
- Limited explicit scale/traffic markers beyond reliability stat; could be read as smaller-scope work.
- Summary and highlights focus on intent more than operational outcomes or platform reliability lexicon.

Keyword Gaps + Suggested Phrases
- Payments processing: “authorization/capture,” “settlement,” “reconciliation,” “disputes/chargebacks,” “refunds,” “payouts.”
- Platform reliability: “SLOs/SLAs,” “incident response,” “on-call,” “runbooks,” “resiliency,” “fault tolerance.”
- Compliance/risk (only if accurate): “PCI,” “fraud/risk controls,” “auditability.”
- Architecture/operations: “payment orchestration,” “idempotency,” “retry safety,” “rollout safeguards,” “migration safety.”

Recruiter Objections & Fixes
- Objection: “Payments impact is unclear; reads like general web engineer.” Fix: add payments-specific nouns to 2–3 experience bullets and project impact notes.
- Objection: “Reliability focus isn’t backed by ops language.” Fix: add “incident readiness/on-call/SLOs” where already implied.
- Objection: “Scope and ownership unclear.” Fix: replace “supported/built” with ownership verbs where accurate (e.g., “led,” “drove,” “delivered”).
