# Internal Notes


## 2026-02-13 16:26 — content-strategist
- Focused on fullscreen resume copy only; did not change layout.
- Priority: tighten summary, highlights, and experience bullets for 6-second scan; preserve truthfulness.
- Noted a future-dated project (2026) and a standalone metric (<250ms) without nearby attribution.
- Kept suggested edits to <=10 items; emphasized payments platform scope and reliability.
