## Micro style guide (5 rules)
1) Lead with concrete domain focus; avoid global-impact claims.
2) Prefer active, direct verbs; cut filler and qualifiers.
3) Keep interests short and vivid; avoid stacked clauses.
4) Use consistent phrasing across summary, bullets, and captions.
5) Favor plainspoken confidence over hype or grand mission language.
