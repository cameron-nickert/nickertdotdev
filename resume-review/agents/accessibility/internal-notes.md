- Reviewed fullscreen resume TSX/CSS for semantics, contrast, focus, and print.
- Risks: low-contrast issue bar subtitle, muted metadata in print, non-list semantics for skills/interests, links lack visible focus/underline.
- Planned minimal fixes: ul/li for skills/interests, focus-visible + underline for contact links, darken issue bar subtitle, stronger print colors + link underline.
