# Internal Notes

- Update reflects demotion of left blocks and lighter contact pills; Experience now the only loud panel.
- Remaining scan traps: issue bar intensity, contact pill boxes, wins/skills pill saturation/rotation, projects too similar to experience.
- Recommend CSS-first tweaks: reduce issue bar prominence, demote wins/skills, widen right column, reduce project heading size.
