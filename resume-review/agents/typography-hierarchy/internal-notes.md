# Typography & Hierarchy Specialist — Internal Notes

Date: 2026-02-13

What changed since last pass
- Role/title contrast and contact styling improved; line-height is slightly looser.
- Experience is now the only loud panel; left column is calmer.

Remaining hierarchy concerns
- Experience/project item heads are still rendered as `p` tags and read like body text.
- Item-head size is still close to body; bullets feel nearly equal weight.
- Body and bullet line-height remains tight for one-page scanning.
- Issue bar remains typographically loud relative to the header.
- Contact pills are still small, with tight line-height for quick scanning.

Proposed direction
- Promote item heads to `h3` and bump size/letter-spacing slightly.
- Increase line-height for body and bullets to ~1.3.
- Nudge issue bar size/spacing down to keep Name → Role dominant.
- Slightly increase contact size/line-height without adding weight.
