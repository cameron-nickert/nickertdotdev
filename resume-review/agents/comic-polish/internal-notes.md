# Comic Polish - Internal Notes (2026-02-13)

- Re-read shared brief/issues/decisions and all agent outputs after the latest implementation.
- Current state is cleaner: only Experience is blockLoud; bursts and textures still add noise around the header and body.
- Remaining clutter: rotations on project cards and skill pills, heavier endcap shadow, and slightly strong burst opacity.
- Plan: keep signature comic artifacts (issue bar, tape, skyline, halftone) but tone down repeated motion/shadow cues.
- Risk: over-reducing texture/shadow could make the page feel corporate; preserve one strong artifact per region.
