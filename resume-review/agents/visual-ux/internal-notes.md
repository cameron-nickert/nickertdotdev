# Internal Notes

## 2025-02-14 visual-ux
Reviewed fullscreen resume layout against scan path and print legibility. Visual noise is coming from stacked tilts/shadows/badges competing with the primary story. Header reads well but contact chips compete with name/role. Experience and projects cards share same weight, blurring priority. Needs clearer rhythm: larger header lead, quieter utility blocks, and more predictable spacing cadence.
