# Internal Notes

- Source set reviewed: brief, issues log, conflicts, and all agent outputs (post-update).
- Merge priorities applied: readability first, then scanflow, then accessibility, then style flourish; keep one-page safety and prefer CSS-first changes.
- Current risk focus: issue bar/contact pills still compete with header identity, project cards still close to experience hierarchy, header height constraints, print margin mismatch.
- Conflicts to resolve: scanflow improvements vs structural TSX changes; column bias vs overflow risk; print safety vs screen identity.
