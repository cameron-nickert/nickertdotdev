# Agent 07 Draft Plan (Refined)

## Brand voice guide
Do
- Lead with outcomes and credibility, then add comic flavor.
- Keep headlines short and scannable.
- Use basketball-first metaphors; cars only for speed/engineering energy.

Don't
- Overuse exclamation points or SFX.
- Hide key info behind jokes.
- Reference specific car brands.

Examples
- Do: "Full-time software engineer who ships fast, clean UI." -> "Shopify, Indeed, Ford."
- Do: "Playbook to production." -> "Clear plan, reliable delivery."
- Don't: "I break the internet (in a good way)."

## Final hero pitch selection
Primary
- "Full-Time Software Engineer." (title must stay)
- Hero pitch: "Empowering the world with one line |"
- Subhead: "UI-forward engineering with motion-friendly performance. M.S. Software Engineering. Shopify, Indeed, Ford."

Backup (A/B test)
- "Full-Time Software Engineer."
- Hero pitch: "Software that moves fast and lands clean."
- Subhead: "I build reliable UI and systems with measurable impact. M.S. Software Engineering. Shopify, Indeed, Ford."
