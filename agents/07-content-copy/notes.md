# Agent 07 Content Copy Notes

## Voice principles
- Comic-book energy with professional clarity; playful, not juvenile.
- Short, punchy sentences; easy to scan in 30 seconds.
- Confidence with receipts: use outcomes, roles, and tools.
- Metaphor supports meaning, never replaces it.

## Tone boundaries
- Do: bold, witty, energetic, precise, helpful.
- Don't: try-hard slang, meme speak, forced jokes, over-caps.
- Avoid: excessive onomatopoeia, sarcasm at the user, or anything that hides the CTA.

## Assumptions
- Brand name and URL are TBD; use placeholders like [Name].
- Audience includes recruiters/hiring managers; keep credibility high.
- Must-have sections: Home, About, Work, Contact.
- Theme blend: comic panels + basketball + cars.
- Reduced motion and view-as-list are required toggles.
