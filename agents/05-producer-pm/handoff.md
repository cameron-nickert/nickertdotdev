# Handoff

## Recommendation
- Timeline: 8-week plan.
  - Rationale: keeps ambition for multiple wow moments while preserving QA and performance time.

## MVP Scope (jaw-dropping but controlled)
- Six scenes: Home, My Story, Work (index), Work (detail), Resume, Contact.
- One light easter egg (tap/drag micro interaction).
- Reduced motion mode and mobile-first layout.

## Locked MVP Wow Moments
- Hero multi-panel splash with ball-to-wheel transformation.
- Scroll-revealed action lines + halftone texture overlays.
- SFX pop-ups on key interactions with comic typography.
- Panel-to-panel scene transition (comic tab bar slide).
- Work grid reveal with “locker/garage” treatment.
- Contact “pit stop” form micro-interaction.
- Easter egg micro-interaction (tap cone for mini effect).
- Reduced motion mode with equivalent static wow composition.

## Top 5 Must-Not-Slip Milestones
- Style guide + panel language lock (end of Week 1).
- Animatic/prototype validated (end of Week 2).
- Hero scene and nav shell built (end of Week 3).
- All MVP scenes complete (end of Week 5).
- Performance + accessibility pass complete (end of Week 7).

## Top Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Performance from layered textures/motion | Asset budgets, mobile simplification, lazy load |
| Animation complexity | Reuse motion patterns, limit unique interactions |
| Asset pipeline delays | Placeholders, staged deliveries by priority |
| Mobile UX issues | Dedicated mobile QA, larger targets |
| Scope creep | Strict MVP list, V2 parking lot |
