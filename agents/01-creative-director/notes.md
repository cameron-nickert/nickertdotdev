# Creative Director Notes

## Brainstormed ideas
- Site as a comic-book issue titled "Full-Court Horsepower" where each section is a scene.
- Split-energy theme: basketball court lines morph into road lanes; hoops become headlights; backboard becomes billboard.
- The main character is a stylized driver/hooper hybrid; their "power-up" is a basketball slam that ignites a car engine.
- Motion lines and halftone patterns animate on scroll, giving panels a kinetic vibe.
- Primary navigation is a "comic tab bar" with tabs sliding like panels.
- Sound effect words (SFX) appear on interactions: "VROOM!" "SWISH!" "SKRRRT!" "THUNK!" "WHOOSH!".
- The Work section is a "Garage"/"Locker Room" hybrid where projects sit on a wall of lockers and toolboxes.
- The Contact section is a "Pit Stop" scene with a form integrated into a gas pump.
- Hero scene: multi-panel splash, where a ball arcs across panels and transforms into a wheel.
- Easter egg: tap on a traffic cone to start a micro mini-game (shoot free throws with a drag gesture).

## References (described)
- Classic comic layouts with panel gutters, angled panels, and dynamic action lines.
- Japanese sports manga energy (speed lines, exaggerated poses).
- Retro automotive posters with bold colors and speed streaks.
- Vintage halftone print textures and exaggerated onomatopoeia.

## Risks
- Over-animating can hurt performance; need reduced motion and fallback states.
- Too many visual motifs could hurt clarity; must prioritize readability.
- Asset creation scope could balloon; must keep asset list tight and re-usable.

## Assumptions
- Brand name and URL are TBD; can be slotted into wordmark later.
- Audience is creative/recruiter/hiring manager + brand clients.
- Primary goal is portfolio + lead gen.
- Must-have sections: Home, About, Work, Contact.
- Devices: both mobile and desktop.
- Performance: mobile LCP < 2.5s, smooth 60fps interactions.
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA, supports prefers-reduced-motion.
