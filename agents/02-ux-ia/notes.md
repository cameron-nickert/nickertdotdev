# UX/IA Notes

Assumptions
- Audience: recruiters, hiring managers, peers; time-poor and scanning first, then deeper.
- Primary goal: portfolio with clear proof of craft and a fast path to contact.
- Content: 4–6 featured projects, short bio, skills, testimonials or quotes, contact CTA.
- Devices: both mobile and desktop; mobile-first IA.
- Visual theme: wacky comic scenes (basketball + cars) with comic panels and speech bubbles.

User priorities
- See who you are and what you do in <30 seconds.
- Find projects quickly; skim and jump to details.
- Confirm credibility (impact, tools, results) in 2 minutes.
- Contact without friction; multiple methods.

Usability risks
- Overly playful visuals hiding navigation or CTA.
- Motion overwhelming or causing disorientation.
- Comic scene metaphor confusing the information hierarchy.
- Long scrolling without clear section anchors.
- Accessibility failures: contrast, focus order, motion control.

IA priorities
- Persistent, clear nav with labels (Home, Work, About, Contact).
- Scene-based sections with explicit headings and summaries.
- Multiple CTAs: "View Work", "Contact", "Download Resume".
- Each scene includes a quick takeaway for skimmers.

Constraints
- No Ford logos/marks in visuals.
- WCAG 2.2 AA, keyboard, screen reader, prefers-reduced-motion.

If user does nothing, they still get the message
- Hero headline + one-sentence positioning + top 3 proof points + primary CTA visible without interaction.

Low-attention modes
- Toggle: "Skip animation" and "View as list" (persistent and remembered).
- Reduced motion: auto-enable if prefers-reduced-motion.
