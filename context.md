## Summary

I’m a Senior Software Engineer who builds reliable software for small businesses and merchants.

I’ve worked on large-scale payments platforms at Shopify and in startup environments where ownership and speed matter. My work centers on performance and reliability in money-critical systems, plus end-to-end products for local businesses.

I like work that stays close to real users and day-to-day problems. Outside of work, I’m a Detroit sports fan and enjoy traveling, hiking, camping, and boating.
