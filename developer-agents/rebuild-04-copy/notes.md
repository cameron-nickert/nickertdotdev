# Rebuild 04 Copy Notes

- Updated hero, section titles, and key body copy to "Wacky Strong" with "Wacky Lite" alternatives for condensed mode using `tone-strong`/`tone-lite` spans.
- Added controlled SFX microcopy moments on the primary CTA, work card CTA, and contact submit button.
- Added playful UI strings for transitions (chapter cards) and loading (resume preview fine print).
- Kept core signals scannable: role, credibility anchors, impact framing, and contact CTA.

Files touched:
- `app/page.tsx`
- `app/work/page.tsx`
- `components/WorkCard.tsx`
- `content/profile.ts`
- `content/work.ts`
- `app/globals.css`
