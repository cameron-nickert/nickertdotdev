# Rebuild 04 Copy Handoff

## What changed
- Rewrote homepage and work page copy to a bolder, comic tone while keeping role/credibility/impact/CTA clear.
- Added Wacky Strong/Lite variants via `tone-strong`/`tone-lite` spans and CSS density toggles.
- Added a third SFX microcopy moment on the contact submit button.
- Refined profile/work data copy to align with the new tone.

## Notes
- Condensed mode now shows Wacky Lite copy where spans were added; the rest stays Wacky Strong.
- Resume preview fine print now includes a playful loading line.

## Follow-ups
- If new SFX or speech bubble assets land, swap them into `data-sfx-asset` / panel styling.
