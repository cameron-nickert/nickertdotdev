# Rebuild 00 Creative Notes

## Wacky Mode: "Issue #0: The Portfolio That Escaped"
A single, committed direction: the site is a lost first issue of a comic series where the reader is a character. Every section is a panel set, every UI element is a prop, and the page pretends it is a physical comic that is ripping, folding, and yelling at you. The tone is loud, clever, and self-aware without being cringe. The humor is confident and visual-first, with punchlines that land in layout, not jokes in paragraphs.

Key framing beats:
- The site is "Issue #0" with fake collector notes, stamp marks, and overprinted page numbers.
- Panels look hand-cut, not grid-perfect. Borders are bold, skewed, and sometimes broken.
- UI controls feel like comic devices: stamps, scribbles, margin notes, "SFX" bursts.
- The reader is constantly acknowledged as "You" in callouts and margins.
- Every section is a new scene in the issue, each one escalating in chaos.

Non-negotiables honored:
- Usable without animation: every gag works with static layout and typography.
- Reduced motion and condensed mode supported: jokes land via layout, icons, and copy.

## Maximal Comic Visual Language
- Exaggerated panel shapes: trapezoids, jagged edges, torn corners, uneven gutters.
- Over-the-top SFX: large onomatopoeia that acts as visual anchors ("WHAM", "ZING", "KABLAM").
- Chaotic but readable: primary column for content, secondary "margin gag" layer.
- "You are in a comic issue" framing: faux staples, crease marks, corner folds, page numbers.
- Colors: bold primary inks (cyan/magenta/yellow/black) with noisy halftone textures.

## WOW Shock List (12 total, 6 MVP LOCKED)
1) MVP LOCKED: Oversized "Issue #0" cover banner with skewed price box + stamp.
2) MVP LOCKED: Panel borders that break and overlap section edges.
3) MVP LOCKED: Giant SFX bursts used as section headers, not just decoration.
4) MVP LOCKED: Margin notes "editor vs. artist" bickering across sections.
5) MVP LOCKED: Fake fold/tear overlays that frame the content.
6) MVP LOCKED: "You are here" speech bubble that tracks section identity.
7) Dynamic halftone background bands per section, different dot scale.
8) Silly "censored" black bars over ultra-boring words ("professional", "synergy").
9) "Reader mail" pull-quote box that interrupts the Story section.
10) Faux sticker stack for Work: "Certified Weird", "Approved by Cat".
11) Page numbers that joke about being out of order.
12) "Soundtrack" caption strip that lists fake audio cues per section.

## Scene-Level Tone + Gag/Surprise (escalates each section)
Home:
- Tone: explosive cover reveal, bold and immediate.
- Gag: "Issue #0" cover with price box that lists "$0.00 (but you owe me a high-five)".

Who I Am:
- Tone: character bio card with playful exaggeration.
- Gag: "Stats" panel that includes goofy non-skill stats ("Snack agility").

Story:
- Tone: flashback montage in staggered panels.
- Gag: "Reader mail" box interrupts the timeline with a mock complaint.

Work:
- Tone: action sequence with chaotic panels.
- Gag: stickers and "mission badges" slapped onto each project card.

Resume:
- Tone: official file with extra stamps and redactions.
- Gag: black-bar redactions over boring words; a "Top Secret: Not Really" stamp.

Contact:
- Tone: final page cliffhanger.
- Gag: giant "TO BE CONTINUED" burst and a faux signature for the reader to sign.

Comedic progression:
- Each section increases the number of visual interruptions (margin notes, stickers, SFX), but never blocks primary content. The last section is the loudest, but the CTA remains clear.

## Not Cringe Guardrails (strict)
Copy:
- No quirky filler or random meme slang.
- Jokes must be visual-first; text punchlines are short, confident, and sparse.
- Avoid "so random" humor; keep absurdity grounded in the comic framing.
- Never self-deprecate skills or experience.

Interaction timing:
- Never delay core navigation or content for a joke.
- If motion is enabled, keep bursts under 400ms and never loop.
- Reduced motion mode removes all motion gags; content still reads as a comic.

Condensed mode:
- Collapse margins and halve the number of gags; keep one per section.
- Maintain bold typography but simplify the panel borders.
