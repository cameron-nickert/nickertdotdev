# D00 Bootstrap Notes

- Scaffolded Next.js App Router with TypeScript, ESLint, and base structure.
- Global layout sets typography via `next/font` with CSS variables for theme tokens.
- Reduced motion handled in `app/globals.css`; condensed density mode toggled via `data-density` on `html`.
- Placeholder content lives in `content/work.ts`; helper accessors in `lib/work.ts`.
- Hero and work sections are intentionally copy-only until assets arrive.
