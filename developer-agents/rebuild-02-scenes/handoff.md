Rebuild Agent R02 handoff

Current state
- Sections use single full-width comic-page background images (`scene-*-comic-page.png`) with halftone overlay and dulled color.
- Dividers are angled bands with speed-lines, negative margins for bleed, thicker bottom border, and lighter orange fill.
- Footer divider moved into main content; footer content is back in a panel.

Files touched recently
- `app/page.tsx`
- `app/globals.css`
- `components/SiteFooter.tsx`

Open questions
- Divider angle/bleed: confirm if -2deg and current negative margins are final.
- Divider band color: confirm #ff8a6a or adjust.
